The full PHP scripts are made for:

- Displaying images in low res. thumbnails
- Open full screen in full res. with Delete button (both thumbnails and original)
- Generating thumbnails via cron job

## Installation

Require PHP and Apache

1. Place these scripts in your web server (/var/www).
2. Place your images with any sub-folder structure you want (eg. YYYY/MM ...) inside a sub-folder "/var/www/images" (or use a symlink in linux to your existing photo folder)
3. First time scanning: `php /var/www/generate_thumbnails.php >> /var/www/log.txt 2>&1.` (background process to not overload cpu). This will create sub-folders "thumbnails" in every folders (up to 2nd level of images) with low-res pictures
4. Open index.php in a browser to view and manage images! ðŸŽ‰

ðŸ›  Thumbnail Generator (generate_thumbnails.php)

âœ… Set the cron job to run nightly at 3 AM:

`crontab -e`

Add:

`0 2 * * * php /var/www/generate_thumbnails.php >> /var/www/log.txt 2>&1`

## Common issues:

Verify your server has write permissions to photos folders

`ls -l /path/to/images` 

if not, give access to user:group  

`sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/images`
